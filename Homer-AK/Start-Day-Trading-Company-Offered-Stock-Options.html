       I have developed a series of profitable trading strategies for beginners, so they can start with the right foundation, and for experienced traders to take their trading to the next level. 
      Knowing a strategy isn't the same as being able to implement it. If you’ve traded before, you’re an active day trader, and maybe you’ve made or lost some money, but you want proven new strategies for more consistent profits, then you can get started with the Warrior Pro.    You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. 
      Final Word for Day Trading Beginners Pick a market you are interested in and can afford to trade. Review SpreadEx offer spread betting on Financials with a range of tight spread markets.   
      9:30 am to 11:30 am EST is a two hour period you want to get good at trading. When we finish the three day intensive course, you will be then joining the live trading room to be on with others who speak the same language, understand the same techniques and can enhance your learning time to master the trades.  We also support the new traders with constantly updating our charts, communicating through our forum and follow up webinars.  These online trading discussions give the clarity and re enforcement of the lessons learned in the 3 day intensive course. 
      Whilst the former indicates a trend will reverse once completed, the latter suggests the trend will continue to rise. Once you learn to make money in one market, it is easier to adapt to learn other markets.
