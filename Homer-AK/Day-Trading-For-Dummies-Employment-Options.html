      If you only want to trade for an hour or two, trade the morning session. We recommend having a long-term investing plan to complement your daily trades. 
      This involves buying and subsequently selling financial instruments within the same trading day, such that all positions will usually be closed before the market close of the trading day. There is no cap on how much money you can make.  The amount of money that you can make is determined by your discipline, account size, and your ability to learn and perfect your skills. 
      So you can take a position on the latest news release, product announcement or financial report – as well as technical indicators. This is the same proven system I’ve used to trade the markets everyday.
