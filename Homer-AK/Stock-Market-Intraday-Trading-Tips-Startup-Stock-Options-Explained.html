      The forex market is alive 24 hours a day because there’s always a global market open somewhere, as a result of differing time zones. In the futures market, you could trade crude oil, gold or S&P 500 movements. 
      Illiquidity will mean the order won’t close at the ideal price, regardless of how good a trader you are. Start with the smallest position size possible when you first begin live trading, as this helps alleviate some anxiety of losing large amounts of money. 
      For further guidance, see our automated trading page. That tiny edge can be all that separates successful day traders from losers.
