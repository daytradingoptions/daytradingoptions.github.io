       Taxes The tax situation for day traders is entirely dependent on in which country the trader is “tax resident”. 
      We have even taught to clients at Lightspeed Financial and Speedtrader. We’ve got one of the longest lists of credibility and trust in the marketplace that surpasses most institutions, but we are also down-to-earth and real.    However, even a consistent strategy can seriously go wrong when confronted with the unusual volume and volatility seen on specific days.
