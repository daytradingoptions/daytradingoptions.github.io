      Risk Management Over 90% of traders who come into the market will fail to make a living as traders. Due to the fluctuations in day trading activity, you could fall into any three categories over the course of a couple of years. 
      Active futures see some trading activity around the clock, so good day trading opportunities typically start a bit earlier than in the stock market. As will be explained below, it’s also worth noting your forex inside day trading strategy will need to be tweaked depending on the currency pair you choose to trade. 
      It can produce substantial losses in a very short period of time.    Use them correctly and you can tap into a potentially profitable trend. 
      Also, continually bring your focus back to what you have practiced and implementing your strategies precisely. Once you learn to make money in one market, it is easier to adapt to learn other markets.   Cash account – Day trading with a cash account (also known as without margin), will allow you to only trade the capital you have in your account. 
      Trading certain futures markets--such as the S&P 500 Emini (ES),which is a very popular day trading futures contract--require only $1000 to get started.
