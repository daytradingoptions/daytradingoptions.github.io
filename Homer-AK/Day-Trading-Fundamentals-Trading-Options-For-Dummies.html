       That means when you’re sat at your desk, staring at your monitors with hands dancing across your keyboard, you’re looking at the best sources of information. 
      So, firm volatility for a trader will reduce the selection of instruments to the currency pairs, dependant on the sessions.    
      This means you can practice all day if you want, even when the market is closed. For day trading we focus primarily on 5 min charts while swing traders focus more on daily charts. 
      From scalping a few pips profit in minutes on a forex trade, to trading news events on stocks or indices – we explain how. We offer you a 14 day free trial for you to see first hand what all of our traders are saying about the room, our analysts, and how they have performed for the day.  It is a very transparent atmosphere.   As a result, you’ll want to be glued to your screen between 0800-2200 (GMT). 
      If you’re day trading online you will close out your position before the markets close for the day to secure your profits.
