      Traditional investing – Traditional investing is a longer game and looks to put money in popular assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate for long-term value appreciation. However, if the trade has a floating loss, wait until the end of the day before exiting the trade. 
      Failure to do so could lead to inaccurate income calculations. This is normally a long-term investing plan and too slow for daily use.
