We have even taught to clients at Lightspeed Financial and Speedtrader. We’ve got one of the longest lists of credibility and trust in the marketplace that surpasses most institutions, but we are also down-to-earth and real. 
      Just as you don't want a single trade to cause a lot of damage to your account (hence the 1% rule), you also don't want one day to ruin your week or month. This is because illiquidity and sharp price movements mean a trade can quickly translate into significant losses as large swings take place or ‘whipsaw’. 
      This means many students are still working full time as they begin to trade the markets.  Instead of attempting to trade through trial and error, our students are participating in a structured learning process designed to teach them everything they need to know to be successful traders. We are looking for stocks that we expect will move in a predictable direction.
