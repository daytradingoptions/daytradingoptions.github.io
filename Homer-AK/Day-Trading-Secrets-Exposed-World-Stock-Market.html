       Forex day trading strategies are concerned with minute by minute fluctuations. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. 
      That means having the best trading platform for your Mac or PC laptop/desktop, having a fast and reliable asset scanner and live stream, and software that won’t crash at a pivotal moment. No two days are the same in the markets, so it takes practice to be able to see the trade setups and be able to execute the trades without hesitation.
