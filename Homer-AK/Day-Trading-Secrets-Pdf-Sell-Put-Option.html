      This is a career you could be doing for the rest of your life and the mastery of skills you develop is truly priceless. However, before venturing into any exotic pairs, it’s worth putting it through its paces with the major pairs. 
      Whilst it may come off a few times, eventually, it will lead to a margin call, as a trend can sustain itself longer than you can stay liquid. The purpose of DayTrading.com is to give you an overview of day trading basics and what it takes for you to make it as a day trader. 
      Forex day trading strategies are concerned with minute by minute fluctuations. While more capital is required to day trade stocks, that doesn't make it a better or worse market than the others.

       That’s why one of the first steps we’ll take is to put you on a trading simulator. It wasn't just my sorry story that convinced me however; it was also the many testimonials and success stories of people who had bought his Day Trading Training. 
      Just as you don't want a single trade to cause a lot of damage to your account (hence the 1% rule), you also don't want one day to ruin your week or month. As a result, a temporary string of bad results won’t blow all your capital.    A Forex Trading Signals are an optional service available. 
      Opt for the learning tools that best suit your individual needs, and remember, knowledge is power. The only question for you is – will the asset rise in value, or not?
