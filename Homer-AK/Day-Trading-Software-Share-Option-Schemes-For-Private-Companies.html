      A few cents extra on a commission is worth it if the company can save you hundreds or thousands of dollars when you have a computer meltdown and can't get out of your trades. Pick a market, that way you can start focusing your education on that market, and not wasting your time learning things about other markets which may not be of help in your chosen market. 
      From scalping a few pips profit in minutes on a forex trade, to trading news events on stocks or indices – we explain how. Trade over 14 Cryptocurrencies directly, traditional forex with low spreads or trade digital options with payouts up to 900%. 
      Now whilst they prevent losses, they also wave goodbye to potential gains. Beginners who are learning how to day trade should read our many tutorials and watch how-to videos to get practical tips.    
      A slow computer can be costly when day trading, especially if it crashes while you are in trades, causes you to miss trades, or its slowness causes you to get stuck in trades. Below we have collated the essential basic jargon, to create an easy to understand day trading glossary. 
      24/5 Trade Signals We monitor the Fx markets 24 hours a day seeking excellent BUY and SELL trade opportunities. Multiple Pairs Trading signals and market analysis are performed for pairs we deem to have reasonable spreads as well as good chart setups. 
      From Demo to Live Trading Most traders notice a deterioration in performance from when they switch from demo trading to live trading.   
      Day trading with Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Ethereum and other altcoins currencies is an expanding business. The remaining 90% give in to frustration and quit. 
      Together we have over seventy years of trading experience in the markets. Is day trading really worth it if you’ll be broke by the end of the first month?
