      Currencies Traded In Forex Major In the forex day trading world, the vast majority of people focus on the seven most liquid currency pairs on earth, which are firstly the four ‘majors’: EUR/USD (euro/dollar) USD/JPY (dollar/Japanese yen) GBP/USD (British pound/dollar) USD/CHF (dollar/Swiss franc) In addition, there are three emerging pairs: AUD/USD (Australian dollar/dollar) USD/CAD (dollar/Canadian dollar) NZD/USD (New Zealand dollar/dollar) These currency pairs, in addition to a variety of other combinations, account for over 95% of all speculative trading in the forex market. Market trends – This is the general direction a security is heading over a given time frame. 
      But if you don't have $25,000 to trade (and can't maintain your account above $25,000) then stocks likely aren't the best day trading market for you. They also offer negative balance protection and social trading. 
      Mentorship Gain the edge by having your very own trading mentor. If this is the case, we recommend disabling these add-ons.
