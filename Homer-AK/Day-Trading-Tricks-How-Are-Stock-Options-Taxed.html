       Liquidity – In the forex market there is an average volume of over $3. This is because it will be easier to find trades, plus you’ll benefit from lower spreads. 
      If you can quickly look back and see where you went wrong, you can identify gaps and address any pitfalls, minimising losses next time. All markets offer great profit potential, therefore it often comes down to how much capital you need to get started.    
      For forex and futures traders, one of the best ways to practice is using the NinjaTrader Replay feature, which lets you trade historical days as if you were trading in real time. It typically sees the most volatility between 0600 and 1700 GMT. 
      Find one strategy that provides a method for entry, setting a stop loss and taking profits. As Benjamin Franklin highlighted, ‘an investment in knowledge pays the best interest’.
