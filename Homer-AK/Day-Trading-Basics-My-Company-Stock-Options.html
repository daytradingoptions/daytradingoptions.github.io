       Opt for the learning tools that best suit your individual needs, and remember, knowledge is power. So, if you want to be at the top, you may have to seriously adjust your working hours. 
      Focusing on precision and implementation will help dilute some of the strong emotions that may negatively affect your trading. For example, if you typically make $500 on winning days, then you are allowed to lose $500 on losing days.
