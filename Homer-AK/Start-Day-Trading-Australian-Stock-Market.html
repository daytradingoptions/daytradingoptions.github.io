      Liquidity – In the forex market there is an average volume of over $3. Brokers on occasion have different definitions for ‘active’ or day traders. 
      Demo trading is a good practice ground for determining if a strategy is viable, but it can't mimic the actual market precisely, nor does it create the emotional turmoil many traders face when they put real money on the line. Take GBP/USD for example, there are specific hours where you have enough volatility to create profits that are likely to negate the spread and commission costs.    
      Just as you don't want a single trade to cause a lot of damage to your account (hence the 1% rule), you also don't want one day to ruin your week or month. Your first three day at the Day trading course you will be in a small group of traders.  You will be working together, going through the steps to build your mastery of the direction of the markets and how to execute orders like a money maker edge trader. 
      Broker integration – With direct links to brokerages, you can automatically execute trades, removing emotional distractions and streamlining the execution process. Robo-advisors – An increasing number of people are turning to robo-advisors. 
      Traditional investing – Traditional investing is a longer game and looks to put money in popular assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate for long-term value appreciation.
