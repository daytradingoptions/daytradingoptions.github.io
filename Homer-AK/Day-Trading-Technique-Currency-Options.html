    </h3>
    <p>
       Regulated in the UK, US and Australia they offer a huge range of markets, not just forex, and offer very tight spreads and a cutting edge platform. 
      Average Trader on the Market Most traders on the market don’t have a proven strategy they can adopt, and instead trade the market through trial and error causing them to lose thousands of dollars and time they can never get back Beginner traders lack a proven trading system to follow that provides them with direction, confidence, and experience. You can also experience a margin call, where your broker demands a greater deposit to cover potential losses.    
      Focus on winning with one strategy before attempting to learn others. You need to order those trading books from Amazon, download that spy pdf guide, and learn how it all works. 
      This will help you keep a handle on your trading risk. Exotic spreads, however, have much more illiquidity and higher spreads. 
      A slow computer can be costly when day trading, especially if it crashes while you are in trades, causes you to miss trades, or its slowness causes you to get stuck in trades.
