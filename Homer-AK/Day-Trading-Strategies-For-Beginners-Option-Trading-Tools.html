       Disclaimer: day trading is high risk, do your own work : The efficacy of both technical analysis and fundamental analysis is disputed by efficient market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. 
      All markets offer great profit potential, therefore it often comes down to how much capital you need to get started. Starting with at least $2500 is recommended, though.  Stocks require at least $25,000 to day trade, making them a more capital-intensive option.

      CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. The average beginner trader gives up less than 1 year after starting. 
      You should consider whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money. That’s why one of the first steps we’ll take is to put you on a trading simulator. 
      Our goal is to teach you our new proven trading strategy.    
      Therefore, if you notice that your trading isn't going very well when you start live (compared to the demo), know that this is natural. However, those looking at how to start a forex day trading business from home should probably wait until they have honed an effective strategy first. 
      So, you can find the best books on strategies for beginners or two-step trend analysis, for example. Other trading rooms and alert services cost $150+ per month. 
      This will help you keep a handle on your trading risk. A trading platform suited to your market and style of day trading. When you are just starting out, finding the perfect platform isn't your goal.   
      Markets.com offer CFDs across a huge range of assets from shares and indices to commodities and cryptocurrencies. At this point, you can kick back and relax whilst the market gets to work. 
      Most brokerage firms will insist you lay down a minimum investment before you can start trading on margin. Furthermore, a popular asset such as Bitcoin is so new that tax laws have not yet fully caught up – is it a currency or a commodity? 
      Take GBP/USD for example, there are specific hours where you have enough volatility to create profits that are likely to negate the spread and commission costs. Plus500 Offer CFD trades via the popular Webtrader online trading platform.
