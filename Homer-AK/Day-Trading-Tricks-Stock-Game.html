      It can still be a good method for the trader who wants to diversify. Education DayTrading.com exists because we could not find a reliable day trading school, university, academy, or institute that runs classes where you can get an all-inclusive day trading education. 
      Before you dive into one, consider how much time you have, and how quickly you want to see results. Choose a time of day that you will day trade, and only trade during that time; typically the best day trading times are around major market openings and closings. 
      We also have a ThinkorSwim course to help you get your virtual account set up as well as an options trading course if you’d like to learn more about options. Stochastics – Stochastic is the point of the current price in relation to a price range over time.
