      If you have more than $25,000, then stocks are a viable day trading market.    The slowest speed offered by your internet provider may do the job, but if you have multiple web pages and applications running (that use the internet) then you may notice your trading platform isn't updating as quickly as it should, and that can cause problems (see above). 
      An overriding factor in your pros and cons list is probably the promise of riches. Yes,  We offer a Free 14 day trial for you to experience our world renown trading room and interact with traders and analysts from around the world.   As a result, you’ll want to be glued to your screen between 0800-2200 (GMT). 
      Just as you don't want a single trade to cause a lot of damage to your account (hence the 1% rule), you also don't want one day to ruin your week or month. The forex market trades 24-hours a day during the week.
