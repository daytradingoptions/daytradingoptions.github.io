    <h3>
       Even more Information Around 
      Start Day Trading 
    </h3>
    <p>
       The definition of “day trading” is the buying and selling of a security in a single trading day. The last hour of the day, 3 pm to 4 pm EST is also typically a good time for trading, as some sizable moves occur then too. 
      For example, forex trading on a memorial day, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day can open you up to unpredictable price fluctuations. Offering tight spreads and one of the best ranges of major and minor pairs on offer, they are a great option for forex traders.    
      This is because instead of manually entering a trade, an algorithm or bot will automatically enter and exit positions once pre-determined criteria have been met. Some of the company’s programs are designed for floor traders at the exchanges who need to learn to trade futures electronically in order to stay competitive, while others work for an average person who wants to get started or who wants to improve his or her trading prowess. 
      So, if you have $10,000 in your account, you wouldn’t risk more than $100 to $200 on an individual trade. We make it clear by giving our Warrior Traders a framework and a foundation that allow them to build their career for life as traders.   
      While some day traders trade for a whole session (9:30 am to 4 pm EST, for example, for the US stock market), most only trade for a portion of the day. You can download our app for forex signals, video course, as well as our Trading Room.
