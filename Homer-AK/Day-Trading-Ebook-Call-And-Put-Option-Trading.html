      Taxes When you read a blog about forex traders, such as ‘a day in the life’, they often leave out the careful consideration that taxes that will be given. Experienced intraday traders can explore more advanced topics such as automated trading and how to make a living on the financial markets. 
      Trading stocks intraday offers different opportunities than a traditional ‘buy and hold’ strategy. Furthermore, that strategy will need to focus on two key factors, liquidity and volatility. 
      Once you learn to make money in one market, it is easier to adapt to learn other markets.
