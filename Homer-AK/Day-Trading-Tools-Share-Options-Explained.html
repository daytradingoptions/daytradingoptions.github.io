       For forex and futures traders, one of the best ways to practice is using the NinjaTrader Replay feature, which lets you trade historical days as if you were trading in real time. 
      How you will be taxed can also depend on your individual circumstances.    
      This limits your potential profits, but it also prevents you losing more than you can afford. We have a thrivingÂ community of traders from all walks of life, ages, genders, and ethnicities from all around the world that support each other like family. 
      Trading Too Soon After the News Big news comes in and then the market starts to spike or plummets rapidly. However, those looking at how to start a forex day trading business from home should probably wait until they have honed an effective strategy first.   A day trader's job is to find a repeating pattern (or that repeats enough to make a profit) and then exploit it. 
      This means you can practice all day if you want, even when the market is closed. So, when the 07:00 (GMT) candlestick closes, you need to place two contrasting pending orders.
