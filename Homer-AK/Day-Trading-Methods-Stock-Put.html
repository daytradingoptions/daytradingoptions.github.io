       If you’re willing to invest the time and energy, then for you, it could well do.Like starting any career, there is a lot to learn when you're a day trading beginner. Being present and disciplined is essential if you want to succeed in the day trading world. 
      Major banks, while they offer trading accounts, typically aren't the best option for day traders. If your internet goes down a lot, that's a problem.    
      However, the intelligent trader will also invest long-term. New Forex broker Videforex can accept US clients and accounts can be funded in a range of cryptocurrencies.
