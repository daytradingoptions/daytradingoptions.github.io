      But if you don't have $25,000 to trade (and can't maintain your account above $25,000) then stocks likely aren't the best day trading market for you. In addition, I'm very stubborn and was convinced I could figure out how to day trade options by myself. 
      In fact, because they are riskier, you can make serious cash with exotic pairs, just be prepared to lose big too. If this is the case, youʼll just need to enter the CAPTCHA code once, and weʼll be able to distinguish between you and the other users on your IP address.
