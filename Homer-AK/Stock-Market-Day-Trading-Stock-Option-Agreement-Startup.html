      Understanding Day Trading 
    </h3>

      Spreads, Leverage & Margin – As a day trader you want competitive spreads – you might also want certain leverage levels and low margins. PDFs – Online you will find a number of forex day trading system PDFs. 
      Taxes The tax situation for day traders is entirely dependent on in which country the trader is “tax resident”. No program can guarantee success, nor is any one program right for every trader. 
      Active futures see some trading activity around the clock, so good day trading opportunities typically start a bit earlier than in the stock market. As a result, you decide when to trade and how to trade.
