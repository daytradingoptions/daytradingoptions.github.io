      The average beginner trader gives up less than 1 year after starting. For example, forex trading on a memorial day, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day can open you up to unpredictable price fluctuations. 
      Recognising that fear is a natural reaction will allow you to maintain focus and react rationally. ‘Pigs get slaughtered’ – When you’re in a winning position, knowing when to get out before you get whipsawed or blown out of your position isn’t easy. You can also experience a margin call, where your broker demands a greater deposit to cover potential losses. 
      Keep a record One of the day trading fundamentals is to keep a tracking spreadsheet with detailed earnings reports. You can also find more detailed and comprehensive lessons in our top tips.    
      The larger brokerage and research firms offer their own training courses, often at little or no cost. Illiquidity will mean the order won’t close at the ideal price, regardless of how good a trader you are.

      When you switch to trading with real capital, a bumpy ride is common for several months. Low commissions – Forex offer relatively low costs and fees compared to other markets. 
      In the futures market, you could trade crude oil, gold or S&P 500 movements.
