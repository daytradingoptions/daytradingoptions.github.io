      As a day trader, you don't need to trade all day. On the other hand, a small minority prove not only is it possible to turn a profit but that you can also make huge returns. 
      The only question for you is – will the asset rise in value, or not? 1200 to 1500 GMT typically see the biggest price moves, so this is a very popular and active time for day traders. 
      Opt for the learning tools that best suit your individual needs, and remember, knowledge is power. 6% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.
