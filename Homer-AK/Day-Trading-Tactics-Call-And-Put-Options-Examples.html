      So, the exchange rate you see from your forex trading account represents the purchase price between the two currencies. Therefore, your trading platform may occasionally change throughout your career, or you may alter how it is set up to accommodate your trading progress. 
      While your average long-term trader may be able to afford to throw in 12 pips (smallest price movement is usually 1%) here and cut 12 there, a day trader simply cannot. In the futures market, you could trade crude oil, gold or S&P 500 movements. 
      These are two of the best indicators for any forex trader, but the short-term trader is particularly reliant on them. We have even taught to clients at Lightspeed Financial and Speedtrader. We’ve got one of the longest lists of credibility and trust in the marketplace that surpasses most institutions, but we are also down-to-earth and real.
