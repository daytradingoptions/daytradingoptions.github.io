      Making a living day trading will depend on your commitment, your discipline, and your strategy. You simple open either a CFD account or a Spread Betting Account to trade in the Foreign Exchange and begin your trading. 
      Tackling your own greed is a hurdle, but one you must overcome. This means traders can make trades six days a week, 24 hours a day. 
      Before you actually jump into the market, you have to have a plan.

       When you switch to trading with real capital, a bumpy ride is common for several months. 
      We have even taught to clients at Lightspeed Financial and Speedtrader. We’ve got one of the longest lists of credibility and trust in the marketplace that surpasses most institutions, but we are also down-to-earth and real.    So, getting the right set up to start day trading forex with price patterns is essential. 
      As you will quickly learn from forex day trading, you should stick to the major and minor pairs in the beginning. The greater the quantity, the greater the potential profit margin.   
      I teach both Day Trading Strategies & Swing Trading Strategies. Exotic spreads, however, have much more illiquidity and higher spreads. 
      Major banks, while they offer trading accounts, typically aren't the best option for day traders. At this point it may be tempting to jump on the easy-money train, however, doing so without a disciplined trading plan behind you can be just as damaging as gambling before the news comes out. 
      FX:1 Academy FX:1 Academy offers in-person training courses in foreign exchange. Futures markets have official closes at different times, but the last hour of trading in a futures contract also typically offers sizable moves for day traders to capitalize on.
