      July 5, 2017 / Forex Articles Head and Shoulders Setup on the AUDJPY Hello Traders,   Here is a sloppy head and shoulders formation that I entered into yesterday.    Day Trading vs The Alternatives Yes, you have day trading, but with options like swing trading, traditional investing and automation – how do you know which one to use? 
      Penny Stocks – These are any stocks trading below $5 a share. Day traders should be using at least a Cable or ADSL type internet connection.   Combined, our trainers have over seventy years of trading experience in the markets.  We trade everyday in our live trading room for you to watch, learn, and trade with us. 
      Education DayTrading.com exists because we could not find a reliable day trading school, university, academy, or institute that runs classes where you can get an all-inclusive day trading education. Furthermore, a popular asset such as Bitcoin is so new that tax laws have not yet fully caught up – is it a currency or a commodity?
