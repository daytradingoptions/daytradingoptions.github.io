      Trade over 14 Cryptocurrencies directly, traditional forex with low spreads or trade digital options with payouts up to 900%. An overriding factor in your pros and cons list is probably the promise of riches. 
      Accessibility – The forex market is readily accessible, open twenty-four hours a day, five days a week. We have coached thousands of day traders towards successful financial careers. 
      If you want to start day trading with no minimum this isn’t the option for you.    
      Illiquidity will mean the order won’t close at the ideal price, regardless of how good a trader you are. You won’t be invited to join that hedge fund after reading just one Bitcoin guide. 
      This is the same proven system I’ve used to trade the markets everyday. Plenty of great and legitimate training firms are out there — as well as a lot of scammers.   
      With tight spreads and no commission, they are a leading global brand. 6% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider. 
      Pick a market, that way you can start focusing your education on that market, and not wasting your time learning things about other markets which may not be of help in your chosen market. Run from anyone who guarantees your success and don’t sign up for a training program until you know what you need to learn. 
      Hence that is why the currencies are marketed in pairs.
