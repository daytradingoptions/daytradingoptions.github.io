       Get good at making money from one market/security before you branch out. 
      The broker you choose is an important investment decision. But if you don't have $25,000 to trade (and can't maintain your account above $25,000) then stocks likely aren't the best day trading market for you.

      Intraday Trading 
    </h3>
    <p>
       Only 10% of the beginner traders in the market will actually be able to make a full time career of it. 
      I have developed a series of profitable trading strategies for beginners, so they can start with the right foundation, and for experienced traders to take their trading to the next level.    
      The last hour of the day, 3 pm to 4 pm EST is also typically a good time for trading, as some sizable moves occur then too. In fact, remember this rule and you’ll never be that one guy on every forex day trading forum that’s lost everything. 
      Starting with at least $2500 is recommended, though.  Stocks require at least $25,000 to day trade, making them a more capital-intensive option. As a result, intraday traders must prepare and anticipate for these unusual market conditions. 
      This is the perfect starting point for beginners on a budget to discover the warrior trading system, here’s what you’ll receive: Chat Room Access (1 Month Access) Real-Time Trading Simulator (1 Month Access) Core Warrior Day Trading Course (1 Month Access) Ch 1. Regulatory changes are pending, and with the sector maturing, these products are now offered by big established brands.
