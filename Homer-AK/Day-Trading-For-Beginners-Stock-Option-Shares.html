      If you can quickly look back and see where you went wrong, you can identify gaps and address any pitfalls, minimising losses next time. A reliable and relatively quick internet connection. 
      Plus500 Offer CFD trades via the popular Webtrader online trading platform. I ended up losing quite a bit of my trading bank before finally admitting I needed Mr X's help. 
      The last hour of the day, 3 pm to 4 pm EST is also typically a good time for trading, as some sizable moves occur then too. Index funds frequently occur in financial advice these days, but are slow financial vehicles that make them unsuitable for daily trades.

       Get good at making money from one market/security before you branch out. 
      But for more detailed examples, see our strategies page on intraday trading techniques. Precision in forex comes from the trader, but liquidity is also important.    Beginners who are learning how to day trade should read our many tutorials and watch how-to videos to get practical tips. 
      With lots of volatility, potential eye-popping returns and an unpredictable future, day trading in cryptocurrency could be an exciting avenue to pursue.   
      I have developed a series of profitable trading strategies for beginners, so they can start with the right foundation, and for experienced traders to take their trading to the next level.

      You can also find more detailed and comprehensive lessons in our top tips. So, if you want to be at the top, you may have to seriously adjust your working hours. 
      However, trade at the right time and keep volatility and liquidity at the forefront of your decision-making process. During this time both London and the US markets are open, trading the euro and the US dollar.
