      This is particularly a problem for the day trader because the limited time frame means you must capitalise on opportunities when they come up and exit bad trades swiftly. The Bullish Bears team also offers a live trading room for day trading, a swing trading room, swing trade and day trading alerts setups, and options trades to our community members. 
      In addition, forex news trading days can also cause periods of significant volatility. Hence the most popularly traded minor currency pairs include the British pound, euro, or yen, such as: EUR/GBP (euro/British pound) EUR/AUD (euro/Australian dollar) GBP/JPY (British pound/Japanese yen) CHF/JPY (Swiss franc/Japanese yen) You can also delve into the trade of exotic currencies such as the Thai Baht, Japanese yen and Norwegian or Swedish krone. 
      Illiquidity will mean the order won’t close at the ideal price, regardless of how good a trader you are.
