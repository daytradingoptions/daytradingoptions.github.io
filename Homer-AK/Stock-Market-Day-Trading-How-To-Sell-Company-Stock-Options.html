       Trading stocks intraday offers different opportunities than a traditional ‘buy and hold’ strategy. So, there is an abundance of trades and moves you can make. 
      As Day Traders and Swing Traders, our mission is simple. Recognising your own psychological pitfalls and separating your emotions is imperative.    
      For day trading we focus primarily on 5 min charts while swing traders focus more on daily charts. Beginners can also benefit from this simple yet robust technique since it’s by no means an advanced trading strategy. 
      This will help you keep a handle on your trading risk. On top of that, many regional currency pairings are also available for trade.
